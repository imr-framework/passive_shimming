# Passive shimming of permanent magnet constructions
Provides passive shimming software and shim tray design outputs

This implementation refactors and builds on the passive shimming demonstrations at 1 and 2.
The specific contributions of this repo are:

1. Shim tray geometery - multi-ring flat top and bottom trays for H, C and double donut type of magnet constructions
2. Generating a 3D printer friendly STL file - natively using magpylib's methods
